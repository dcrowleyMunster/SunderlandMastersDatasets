# SunderlandMastersDatasets
This repository houses various datasets used for training small language models

During the Masters program I have located those datasets I have further augmented for use with my hypothesis of implementing small language models during emergencies to help people manage how they get themselves to safety or others to safety.
The datasets here will liekely be in .csv format. The modified parquet based datasets can be found in the relavent huuggingface HTTP URL's

The pre-trined SLM's tested vary both in number's of parameters and source data format.
